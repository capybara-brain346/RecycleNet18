# RecycleNet: Recyclable Items Classification and Chatbot Guide

## Overview

RecycleNet is a deep learning-based project designed to classify images of recyclable items into 30 distinct categories. Alongside the classification model, a chatbot is integrated to assist users in understanding how to recycle the identified items properly. The goal is to promote effective recycling practices and reduce environmental waste.

## Features
