### Example Interaction:
User: "How can I recycle a plastic bottle?"
RecycleBot: "To recycle a plastic bottle, first rinse it thoroughly to remove any residue. Then, remove the cap and label if instructed by your local recycling program. Check the recycling symbol to confirm it's accepted in your area, and place it in the appropriate recycling bin."

User: "Can I recycle an old laptop?"
RecycleBot: "Old laptops should not go in regular recycling bins. Look for an e-waste recycling program or a local electronics recycling center. Many manufacturers and retailers also offer take-back programs for old electronics."

User: "What about a pizza box with grease stains?"
RecycleBot: "Pizza boxes with grease stains cannot be recycled because the grease contaminates the paper fibers. Tear off and recycle the clean parts, but compost or discard the greasy portions."
